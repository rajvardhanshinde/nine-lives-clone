<div class="ftxt" style="margin-top: -50px;">Our History</div>
<p class="para" style="font-size: 16px;">Founded in 2004, Nine Lives Foundation began in a tiny warehouse space in Redwood <br> City as a cat-only boarding facility originally called The Scratching Post.</p>
<p class="para" style="font-size: 16px;">In 2016, Nine Lives Foundation opened its low-cost spay/neuter and vaccination clinic <br> on Jefferson Avenue in Redwood City, providing veterinary services to our shelter cats <br> and low-cost spay/neuter and vaccination services to the local community.</p>
<p class="para" style="font-size: 16px;">In 2018, the Adoption Center was opened, providing a comfortable and welcoming <br> environment to help find forever homes for our resident cats.</p>
<p class="para" style="font-size: 16px;">In 2021, Nine Lives Foundation went through a transition after the retirement of its Chief <br> Veterinarian and Founder at the end of 2020. Nine Lives continues to serve the <br> community through its low-cost spay/neuter and vaccination services as well as the bt1 rescue, treatment, and adoption of at-risk cats in our local community and beyond.</p>

She works in Legal Operations for a media company based in San Francisco. Mindy is a Bay Area native and life-long animal lover. She has two cats — Birdie, adopted from Nine Lives in 2019, and Bumble, adopted from another Bay Area rescue in 2016. Since she started volunteering for Nine Lives, Mindy has fallen in love with more Nine Lives kitties she can count. Remarkably, she has resisted bringing them all home to live with her.</p>

    <p class="for4">Susan heads up the career services office at Stanford Law School, which she transitioned to after practicing law in the Bay Area for a number of years. She grew up on an apple orchard in Eastern Washington surrounded by cats and dogs. When she and her youngest son finally convinced her husband in 2016 that it was time to get a cat, she felt that some order had been restored to the world. It turned out, however, that one cat was not enough. So, Susan started volunteering at Nine Lives in 2019, and joined the board in 2022. Having unlimited access to cute and cuddly cats and kittens and helping them.</p></div>
